## Research
My research aims at generating advanced technologies for Internet-based collaboration infrastructures. Based on fundamental methodologies of multiagent systems and human computer interaction, I focus on research issues and technological challenges of services computing and Internet of Things (IoT) for realizing the interaction between various cloud services and the physical world. Moreover, I conduct research on intercultural collaboration and multi-language communication based on the Language Grid, a service-oriented language infrastructure we have developed for supporting various collaboration activities.
<br>
<br>
In October 2022, I started a new laboratory at Department of Computer Science, Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology, Okayama University.
