## Research
In October 2022, I started the [Intelligent Computing Laboratory](https://www.ic.cs.okayama-u.ac.jp/en/) at Department of Computer Science, Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology (Graduate School of Environmental, Life, Natural Science and Technology Since 2023), Okayama University. Aiming at building intelligent collaboration infrastructures and systems, we conduct interdisciplinary researches on artificial intelligence (especially multiagent systems) and computing paradigms on the Internet. We focus on (but not limited to) the following research topics.

### Research Topics
#### Methodologies on artificial intelligence and multiagent systems
A device or software with autonomous intentions can be regarded as an agent. Multiagent system is a system where multiple agents coordinate and compete with each other, which is an essential research topic in the area of artificial intelligence. We focus on the research of theories and algorithms for multiagent as foundations for autonomous cooperation and interaction among humans, things, and services. Moreover, we conduct research and development of multiagent reinforcement learning algorithms for real-world scenarios including drone delivery and edge cloud cooperation.

Keywords: Multiagent reinforcement learning; interactive agents; multiagent pathfinding; constraint optimization; agent coordination algorithms; agent-based service-oriented computing; LLM agents; AI agents

#### New technologies for services computing, cloud computing, and IoT
To realize intelligent collaboration infrastructures and systems, we need to address the issues of how to support the interaction between various cloud services and the physical world where we live in. This research topic covers several research areas including services computing, cloud computing, and IoT. We focus on advanced technologies for autonomous cooperation and interaction among humans, things, and services on the Internet. In particular, our research results on cloud service composition and human-service collaboration have been accepted numerous times by top international conferences.

Keywords: QoS-aware service composition; crowdsourcing; service recommendation; cooperative edge cloud computing; self-organizing IoT service network; cooperation among humans, things, and services; task allocation and resource allocation in IoT environments

#### Implementations and applications of real-world collaboration systems
Based on the fundamental research results on multiagent systems and the technological outcomes on human-service collaboration, we conduct implementations of intelligent collaboration systems and apply these systems in real-world scenarios and fields. For example, we are building an IoT/Web service infrastructure that enables the interoperability among various cloud services on the Web and devices in IoT environments. Moreover, we have developed the Language Grid, a service-oriented language infrastructure for supporting intercultural collaboration and multi-language communication activities in the real world.

Keywords: Intercultural collaboration infrastructure; language service infrastructure; IoT/Web service infrastructure; cooperative edge-could infrastructure; service design methodology
