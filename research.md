## Research
My research aims at generating advanced technologies for Internet-based collaboration infrastructures. Based on fundamental methodologies of multiagent systems and human computer interaction, I focus on research issues and technological challenges of services computing and Internet of Things (IoT) for realizing the interaction between various cloud services and the physical world. Moreover, I conduct research on intercultural collaboration and multi-language communication based on the Language Grid, a service-oriented language infrastructure we have developed for supporting various collaboration activities.

### Research Interests
- **Services Computing (Internet of Services)**: QoS-aware service composition, crowdsourcing, service recommendation, language service infrastructure, edge-cloud computing
- **Internet of Things (IoT)**: IoT service infrastructure, self-organizing IoT service network, task allocation and resource allocation in IoT environments
- **Multiagent Systems**: constraint optimization, multiagent reinforcement learning, interactive agents
- **Intercultural Collaboration**: machine translation mediated communication, multi-language communication design, intercultural collaboration support in the real fields
